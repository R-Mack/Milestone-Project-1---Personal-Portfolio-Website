# Project Title

Portfolio of my web dev projects.

## Description

This website is a portfolio of my web dev projects. The user is provided with an easy-to-use example of my skill as a developer, also there is easily identifiable contact details and links to my professional social media profiles. 

## UX

### Project Goals

To create a clean and simple way to display my portfolio of work to potential employers.

### User Stories

Potential Employers want:

1. To quickly be able to find my past projects.
2. To quickly find information about my past education.
3. To quickly and easily find information to contact me.
4. To get a feel for my work capabilities and personality.

### Design Choices

* __Font:__  I chose "Nova Mono" due to it being easy to read yet stylish, fun and professional at the same time.

* __Icons:__ I used icons to improve useability and to keep the site clean.

* __Colours:__ I found a soft blue to look friendly, welcoming and professional. The lightness of the colour worked well at providing contrast for the black text underneath and the white background.

* __Styling:__ The use of cards to display the projects made them easy to navigate and apparent when viewing the homepage. The use of a rounded profile image was use to show my face in a friendly way. The fixed navbar was used to improve visibility on smaller screens. I decided on not including a footer as it would not come accross as friendly as I would of liked.
